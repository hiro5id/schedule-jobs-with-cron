## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please open a draft security advisory here https://github.com/hiro5id/schedule-jobs-with-cron/security/advisories

Please describe the issue as detailed as possible. If at all possible please attach a proof of concept in the ticket.

While security issues are treated with highest priority, and balancing my daily and other commitments, updates should be expected within a few days or a week at maximum.

If a vulnerability is accepted it will be worked on until it is adressed or a reasonable outcome is reached.  
If it is declined the related ticket will be closed with an explanation.

I am grateful for the communities effort to identify security issues.
