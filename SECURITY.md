## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please open an issue in github here https://github.com/hiro5id/schedule-jobs-with-cron/issues and choose the label `Security`.  It would also be helpful
to assign it to [hiro5id](https://github.com/hiro5id) so that I receive an email notification about it.

If at all possible please attach a proof of concept in the ticket, describing the security issue.  Or detailed explanation about where and what the 
security concern is.

Updates on the `Security` tickets are always highest priority, while balancing my daily and other commitments but it should be within a few days or a week
at maximum.

If a vulnerability is accepted it will be worked on until it is adressed or a reasonable outcome is reached.  
If it is declined the related ticket will be closed with an explanation.

I am grateful for the communities effort to identify security issues.
